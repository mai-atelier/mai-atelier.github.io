                        <h3><b>Hick's Law</b></h3>
                        <p>L'Occitane</p>
                        <a href = "https://www.loccitane.com/en-us" target="_blank">loccitane.com</a>
                        <div class="img-box"><img src="images/loccitane-haircare-op.png" alt="searching hair care products from concerns and product types"></div>
                                <p>Loccitane is the French skincare brand having nice item lists, including a bunch of products.  
                                I want to focus on the list that used Hick's law in the menu navigation on their websites.
                                Hick's law defines an idea the more options will take more time for users.                                         
                                 Here is one of the examples from the list about hair care.
                                 The section splits into two categories of concerns and product type, so they approach two different ways to help find what the user wants. </p>
                                 <div class="img-box"><img src= "images/loccitane-hairconcerns-op.png" alt="hair conditions"></div>
                                 <div class="img-box"><img src= "images/loccitane-hairproducts-op.png" alt="hair care product lists"></div>
                                <p>
                                This user-friendly navigation leads the users to choose the exact product as the solution based on the needs and preferences. 
                                It helps to eliminate the number of choices but also suggests the right solution that suits the user.
                                </p>

                        <h3><b>Contrast</b></h3>
                        <p> Notion</p>
                        <a href = "https://www.notion.so" target="_blank">notion.so</a>
                        <div class="img-box"><img src="images/notion.png" alt="notion sign up"></div>
                                <p> Creating contrast increases visual awareness and provide a focus on the important information. 
                                I think the notion website has beautiful contrasts with consists the visual hierarchy. 
                                The page contrasts with different types of elements such as fonts, colors, illustrations, and photos.  
                                The example view of the service of the bottom image looking different from other elements.</p>

                                <p>The fonts are the same typeface, but it is different in sizes and font colors with grayscale.
                                The page has a clear contrast of white background and black elements. 
                                The bold tagline pulls the user's eyes quickly with the image, also black and white. </p>    

                                <p>The accent color for the call-to-action button is greyish red contrasting with the white fonts, so the button looks different from other elements to grab the attention. 
                                The site also contrasts with their style of using emoji in triad colors. 
                                These small portions of elements with colors making the look sophisticated. </p>

                        <h3><b>Rule of Thirds</b></h3>
                        <p>Patagonia Provisions</p>
                        <a href = "https://www.patagoniaprovisions.com" target="_blank">patagoniaprovisions.com</a>
                        <div class="img-box"><img src="images/patagoniaprovisions.png" alt="morning fishing at ocean, cut avocados on the plate, and cracker towers"></div>
                                <p>
                                The rule of thirds is the beautiful layout of making the page appealing by creating depth and contrast in the views. 
                                I can find the rule of thirds in the image of the photos from the Patagonia Provisions site. All of the three images use the principle.
                                Can you recognize the ratio of one-third in each photo?  </p>  
                
                                <p>First, the objects and colors of people riding on the fishing boat concentrated one-third vertical. 
                                On the other side of one-third, I can see the seagulls are flying. 
                                In the rest of the photos, the main food objects are in the middle space of one-third. 
                
                                Second, the avocados are aligning in the center of the plate. 
                                It may look like putting them arbitrarily, but they remain in the frame of one-third of the middle. 
                
                                Last, the crackers of the last photo are exactly in one-third of the middle horizontally. 
                                Also, the texts appear following the horizontal line of one-third on it. </p>
                
                                <p>Using the rule of thirds in photos keeps the look elegant.  
                                It makes the page have more space without additional white branks that can cause more scrolling in small browsers.</p>
